# The number guessing game

This is a simple number guessing game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and challenges the user to guess it. The program then gives feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low and allows the user to keep guessing until the number is correctly guessed. The program also tracks the number of attempts.

# Steps
- A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- The program provides feedback:
  - "Too small" if the user's guess is smaller than the generated number.
  - "Too big" if the user's guess is bigger than the generated number.
- The loop continues until the user guesses correctly.
- The number of attempts is displayed at the end.
